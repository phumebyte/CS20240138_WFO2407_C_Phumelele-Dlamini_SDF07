                        A software development student who spends her time delving deep into the world of programming, I dedicate myself to mastering the craft. My days are filled with reading notes, using interactive programming tutorials on Scrimba, and watching YouTube videos to reinforce my learning. Whether it's experimenting with new coding techniques or building small projects on FreeCodeCamp, I'm constantly pushing myself to learn more and improve. When I'm not attending a session with my coach, you'll find me tackling coding challenges to make sure I understand my work.

                        But it's not all code all the time—I’m also a pretty creative person. I love making art in my free time, and it’s a great way to relax and let my imagination run wild. Plus, I’m a bit of a bookworm and enjoy getting lost in a good story, whether it's fiction, sci-fi, or something that expands my horizons. And when I need a break, I turn to interactive mobile games, which not only entertain me but also spark my interest in app development and user experience design. Balancing my technical side with my creative hobbies keeps me inspired and helps me approach problems from different angles.

                    <p>
                        Looking ahead, I’m aiming to land a role as a junior full stack developer at a cool, creative company in a major city. I’m also gearing up to get my Java Associate certification next year, which will help me develop my own geo-tracking app—something I’m really excited about. Ultimately, I want to blend my love for coding with my interest in psychology to become a cognitive scientist specializing in AI. My dream is to create AI models that really understand and interact with people in meaningful ways, making tech that truly enhances our lives.
